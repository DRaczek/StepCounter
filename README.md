# StepUp

StepUp is an android application built with .NET MAUI designed to track your daily steps, convert them into distance and calories, and visualize your activity history. The app uses `Plugin.Maui.Pedometer` for step counting and some of Syncfusion components for UI.

## Technologies

-   [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/)
-   [CommunityToolkit.MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/)
-   [Plugin.Maui.Pedometer](https://github.com/jfversluis/Plugin.Maui.Pedometer)
-   [SQLite-net-pcl](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) for local step storage
-   [Syncfusion MAUI Components](https://github.com/syncfusion/maui-toolkit) â€“ Carousel, Charts, ProgressBar, SfNumericEntry

> **Note:** `Plugin.Maui.Pedometer` works best on a physical device. Step readings may not work correctly on an emulator.

## Usage Notes

## Known bugs and issues

-   Foreground service is being terminated by the system at some point (don't know why yet)
-  Permissions on the first launch are not applied correctly; sometimes the app needs to be restarted twice along with the foreground service for it to work as intended.

> **Note:** UI was tested on only on 3 devices and the functionalities only on 1 (Galaxy M35). Since i don't have access to any IOS device I couldn't implement nor test the app on such device.
